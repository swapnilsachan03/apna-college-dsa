## Order of Problems

1. Introduction
2. Tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder)
3. Buld a tree from inorder & preorder
4. Build a tree from inorder & postorder
5. Level order traversal
6. Find the sum of all nodes at kth level
7. Count & sum of all nodes in a tree
8. Height of a binary tree
9. Diameter of a binary tree

We cannot build a binary tree from given preorder & postorder sequences until & unless it is a complete binary tree
