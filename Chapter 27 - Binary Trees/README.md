## Order of Problems

1. Introduction
2. Tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder)
3. Buld a tree from inorder & preorder
4. Build a tree from inorder & postorder
5. Level order traversal    *`!concept`*
6. Find the sum of all nodes at kth level
7. Count & sum of all nodes in a tree
8. Height of a binary tree
9. Diameter of a binary tree
10. Sum replacement in a binary tree
11. Height balanced binary tree
12. Right view of binary tree
13. Left view of binary tree
14. Distance between two nodes in a binary tree
15. Flatten a binary tree    *`!concept`*
16. Print all nodes at distance k in binary tree    *`!hard`*
17. Lowest common ancestor of two nodes    *`!important concept`*
18. Maximum path sum from one node to another    *`!medium`*

We cannot build a binary tree from given preorder & postorder sequences until & unless it is a complete binary tree
