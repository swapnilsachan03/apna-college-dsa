## Order of Problems

1. BSTs - introduction & build
2. Search and delete in a binary search tree    *`!concept`*
3. Build BST from preorder    *`!concept`*
4. Build BST from postorder
5. Check for Binary Search Tree    *`!concept`*
6. Build a balanced BST from sorted array
7. Catalan numbers application
8. Possible BSTs with N nodes    *`!extremely hard`*
9. Zig zag traversal of a BST

Inorder traversal of a BST gives us a sorted array.
