## Order of Problems

1. BSTs - introduction & build
2. Search and delete in a binary search tree    *`!concept`*
3. Build BST from preorder    *`!concept`*
4. Build BST from postorder
5. Check for Binary Search Tree    *`!concept`*
6. Build a balanced BST from sorted array
7. Catalan numbers application
8. Possible BSTs with N nodes    *`!extremely hard`*
9. Zig zag traversal of a BST
10. Check for identical binary search trees
11. Largest BST in a binary tree    *`!strategy`*
12. Recover binary search tree    *`!hard`*
13. Set and multiset

Inorder traversal of a BST gives us a sorted array.

Sets and multisets are implemented using balanced BSTs, however, unordered sets are implemented using hashing. Random access isn't possible in any of the sets.
